# MiningSimulator
Due to the GPU shortage, I have been drooling to make my own mining rig, yet no matter what I can never seem to be able to either make one or make one that's profitable, this is what the crypto mining simulator is for, instead of drooling over nothing, come and join us on an adventure where you can build your own masses of rigs in your basement! Its also quite educational for people who just heard about mining a few minutes ago!

V 0.1
First release of the mining simulator, there is no basement functionality yet but in the future you can have multiple rigs and walk around your basement with fan upgrades
